HANGMAN GAME:-

    hangman is a paper and pencil gussing game for two or more players.one player thinks of a word,phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess  it by  
    the suggesting letters within a certain number of gueses. Hangman is kind of offensive to begin with  ,but it's mainly this cover that really puts an unpleasant story of game .
    the player guessing the world may ,at any time attempt to guess the whole word,igthe world is correct,the game is over and the guesser wins.outherwise,
    the other player may choose to penlize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram on the other hand ,if the  guesser
     makes enough incorrect guesses to allow the other player to complete the diagram,the guesser looses
     
     
     The following example game illustrates a player trying to guess the word hangman using a strategy based solely on letter frequency. 
     As the player continues, a part of the stick figure on the noose is added.Once a full body is drawn, the game is over, and the player lost.
